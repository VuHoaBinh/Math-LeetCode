Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
